The thing in the middle is the CPU or the processor. That thing does the calculations we need to be done.

It understands only machine code,  that is Binary (Ones and zeros)
## Memory (RAM)

This is where all the working data is stored. This is linear in nature.

The main features of primary memory(RAM), which distinguish it from secondary memory are −
- It can be accessed directly by the processor
- It is very fast memory.
- It is volatile, i.e. its contents are lost once power is switched off
- It is used for temperary storage of data. 

## Secondary Memory

This is the long term store

**Operating system (OS)** is the lifeline of computer. You connect all the basic devices like CPU, monitor, keyboard and mouse; plug in the power supply and switch it on thinking you have everything in place. But the computer will not start or come to life unless it has an operating system installed in it because OS −
-   Keeps all hardware parts in a state of readiness to follow user instructions
-   Co-ordinates between different devices
-   Schedules multiple tasks as per priority
-   Allocates resource to each task
-   Enables computer to access network
-   Enables users to access and use application software


## File Management
Data and information is stored on computers in form of files. Managing file system to enable users to keep their data safely and correctly is an important function of operating systems. Managing file systems by OS is called **file management**. File management is required to provide tools for these file related activities −

-   Creating new files for storing data
-   Updating
-   Sharing
-   Securing data through passwords and encryption
-   Recovery in case of system failure
