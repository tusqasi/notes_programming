## Variables
Variables are named boxes of data.

```py
first_name = 10
```

This code makes a variable named `first_name` and puts a value of `10` inside it. We can now use this value later.

`=` is the assignment operator, unlike in maths.
There are some rules for variable names
	- No special characters others than numbers and `_`(Underscore).
	 - ❌
		- `9_last_name` 
		- `$rate`
	- ✅
		- `CURRENT_VALUE`
		- `RA_TE`
		- `name_1`
	- Variable name can't start with a number

## Simple operators
operators do stuff in python.
example.
These are basic math operators
`=`, `-`, `+`, `/` 
```py
x = 3
y = 5
z = (y*x  + x) / 3
```
